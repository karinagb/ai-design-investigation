# AI Design Investigation

<br> 

# Auto Draw
-	There are not premium plans or something to pay for
-	You draw something fast and it shows you similar draws that you can choose
-	It is like an autocorrect for draws
-	Does not show half lines, for example, where is the center of each side of the page.
-	Does not autoalign or add images

<br> 

# Draw3D
-	https://draw3d.online/
-	Transform sketch into images
-	Sometimes to exaggerated, and does not coordinate colors, for example, there is a tree with a hill and it transformed the hill in a sand hill
-	It is not accurate, for example from a draw of a girl, that has asymmetric eyes and eyebrow, it made them symmetric and add earings
-	It could have super high quality

# Genie for Figma
-	A figma plugin
-	You can type a general description of the content that you want and it adds a medium long text that matches your idea
-	Also you could add images typing a basic description
-	You have to create the environment for that content or image to be in


<br> 

# AI Color palette generator
-	You could write a description and it generates a color palette that matches that description.
-	For example, if you write “rain forest” it will show different green and brown tones.

<br> 

# Prompt2Figma
-	It creates cards with header, p and buttons
-	You can edit the colors, borders and size of everthing
-	The cards are too simple, you have to be extremely specific with the font, type, size and color, with the background color, etc. That means that it helps the designer to develop the ideas that he/she already has, not to generate all the design with templates and decoration

<br> 

# Mid Journey
-	AI for images, website designs, etc
-	It generates images but also all the entire design of the page
-	you could be as specific as you want and it will show something that matches that. Also if you are not really sure about the idea that you have, you could say something more abstract and it will be as accurate as possible
-	it will generate 4 images and for each 2 buttons. For example, for the 1st image, the  u1 button will upscale the 1st image with higher resolution, and the v1 will generate more versions of the 1st image 
-	you have to write a specific prompt to mid journey to understand you, for example if I want a website for elegant cloth products with 500 stylize (stylize means the esthetic of the images)
<sub> /imagine fancy website for cloth products --v 4 stylize 500 </sub>
-	also you could ask for more characteristics for the page, for example, ui/ux, colors, type of image, etc.
<sub>/imagine fancy website for cloth products, ui, ux, ui/ux, green, white, beige --v 4 stylize 500</sub>
-	here it will generate the entire web design for the product, with the menu, titles, p, buttons, also other similar products, etc. 
- finally, you could add a link for reference if you want your page to look similar to some other page

# Uizard
-	AI for website designs
-	It is an autodesigner where you could select the device for the page, the main description if the entire project (you could be really specific about it) and describe the style that you are looking for
-	It results in a website design for your page. It has different designs for each section of the page with headers, paragraphs, buttons and images
-	It is really cool and works perfectly for simple website designs. It generates a page designed with little decoration and detail, not as “artistic” and colorful as midjourney.
-	 It’s serious and formal design could be a better fit for a clinic, law firm or something more reserved business.
